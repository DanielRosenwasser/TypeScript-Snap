  optional types, classes, and modules to JavaScript. TypeScript supports tools
  for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any
  OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript.

# TypeScript isn't meant to be invoked with the command 'typescript'.
# These entries will install an executables named 'typescript.tsc' and 'typescript.tsserver',
# each for the respective entries in 'bin'.
# Once we publish, we'll have also set up an alias for 'tsc' and 'tsserver' respectively'
apps:
  tsc:
    command: tsc
  tsserver:
    command: tsserver

    # Since our 'source' is based a remote repository (as opposed to local sources),
    # Snap's build servers will rebuild this package once a day if TypeScript's repo 
    # has any upstream changes.
